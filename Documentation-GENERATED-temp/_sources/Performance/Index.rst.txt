Performance Considerations
============================

Critical Information for Production Deployment
==============================================

.. important::
   This extension implements **site-wide cache synchronization** to solve temporal content issues.
   Understanding the performance implications is critical before deploying to production.

   **Read this documentation completely before production deployment.**

Overview
========

The TYPO3 Temporal Cache extension solves Forge #14277 by dynamically adjusting cache lifetime
based on temporal content transitions. The extension provides flexible optimization strategies
to match different site sizes and requirements.

**Key Performance Factors:**

‚úÖ **Solves 20-year-old temporal content bug** - Automatic cache invalidation
‚ö†Ô∏è **Site-wide cache synchronization** - Phase 1 architectural constraint
‚úÖ **Mitigation strategies available** - Scoping, timing, harmonization
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance implications** - Varies by site size and configuration
üîÑ **Future improvements** - Phase 2/3 will eliminate constraints

.. important::
   For most small to medium sites (<10,000 pages, <50 transitions/day), the benefits
   (correct temporal behavior) far outweigh the costs (moderate performance impact).

   For large or high-traffic sites, **thorough testing is mandatory** before production.

Summary: Key Takeaways
======================

**Benefits:**

‚úÖ Solves 20-year-old temporal content bug (Forge #14277)
‚úÖ Automatic, zero-configuration operation
‚úÖ Multiple optimization strategies available
‚úÖ Works today with TYPO3 v12/v13 LTS

**Constraints:**

‚ö†Ô∏è Site-wide cache synchronization (Phase 1 limitation)
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance implications for large/high-traffic sites
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires thorough testing before production
‚ö†Ô∏è Database queries on every cache generation (~5-10ms)

**Future:**

üîÑ Phase 2/3 will eliminate performance concerns through core integration
üîÑ Extension will become obsolete when TYPO3 core provides native support
üîÑ Your production experience helps shape Phase 2/3 design

See :ref:`phases` for complete roadmap and migration path.

Automatic cache invalidation for time-based content in TYPO3.

Addresses `TYPO3 Forge Issue #14277 <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/14277>`__:
Menus and content with starttime/endtime update automatically when time passes,
without manual cache clearing.

.. important::
   **Extension Status**: Stable and production-ready.

   **Approach**: This is an **experimental solution** implementing Phase 1
   of a three-phase approach. The extension provides a pragmatic workaround
   until TYPO3 core provides native temporal cache support (Phase 2/3).

   See :ref:`phases` for the complete roadmap and migration path.
